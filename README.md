# Lectures
Lecture code and resources for COMP1005

## Organisation

Each lecture's resources are contained in a directory LectureX, which has its own README to explain how they fit into the lecture.

## Usage and attribution

Please contact v.maxville@curtin.edu.au if you are using the materials, and provide an attribution. This is mostly so we know where and how the work is being used.
